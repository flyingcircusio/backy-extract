SYNOPSIS
========

**backy-fuse** [**-d** *BACKUPDIR*] *MOUNTPOINT*


DESCRIPTION
===========

Provide access to all backy backup images of a source via a virtual filesystem.
They can be loop-mounted to retrieve individual files from backups. Each
revision found will be exported as individual image. Images are made accessible
in read-write mode, but modifications are never written to the underlying chunk
store.

See **Examples** below for a restore walk-through.


OPTIONS
=======

**-d** *BACKUPDIR*, **--basedir** *BACKUPDIR*
    Backy data directory containing `*.rev` files.

**-o** *MOUNTOPTS*, **--mountopts** *MOUNTOPTS*
    Additional options to pass to the underlying **mount(8)** invocation.
    Defaults to **allow_root** which lifts the restriction that the superuser is
    normally unable to access FUSE filesystems. See **fuse(8)** for a list of
    allowed options.

**-c** *NUM*, **--cache** *NUM*
    Cache size in MiB. backy-fuse creates two caches of the same size, one as
    read-only cache and the other as dirty cache. So specifying 512 MiB means
    that up to 1 GiB can be used.

**-V**, **--version**
    Show version.

**-h**, **--help**
    Show brief or detailed help screen.


EXIT STATUS
===========

Please note that backy-fuse runs as long as the filesystem is mounted. Use
**fusermount -u** *MOUNTPOINT* to unmount the filesystem recovery has been
finished.

0
    FUSE filesystem has been mounted and unmounted successfully.
1
    Backup directory could not be locked or revision list could not be initialized.

backy-fuse does not exit on I/O error but reports them through the mounted
filesystem.


ENVIRONMENT
===========

RUST_LOG
    Enable additional logging to stderr. Set to **info** or **debug** to
    increase level of verbosity.


FILES
=====

/etc/fuse.conf
    Must contain **user_allow_other** so that the FUSE filesystem can be mounted
    with the default **allow_root** option. Invoke backy-fuse with **-o ""** if
    that setting is not available.


EXAMPLES
========

1. Explore revisions
--------------------

Mount backup images to `/mnt/backy`::

    $ backy-fuse -d /srv/backy/testvm /mnt/backy

(backy-fuse keeps running)

Then explore or copy images from a second terminal::

    $ ls -l /mnt/backy

Don't forget to unmount the FUSE filesystem when finished::

    $ fusermount -u /mnt/backy


2. Restore files
----------------

Mount backup images::

    $ backy-fuse -d /srv/backy/testvm /mnt/backy-fuse

Select revision to restore from. In this example, we will be restoring from
revision `tAGKE5rrxReggVMtoPSr7`.

Set up loop device to access partitions inside the image::

    # losetup -f -P --show /mnt/backy-fuse/tAGKE5rrxReggVMtoPSr7
    /dev/loop0

Loop mount the image::

    # mount -oro /dev/loop0p1 /mnt/restore

If the image does not contain a partition table, use `/dev/loop0` instead of
`/dev/loop0p1` for example.

After finishing restore operations, unmount the loop mount first::

    # umount /mnt/restore

Then unregister the loop device::

    # losetup -d /dev/loop0

Finally, unmount the FUSE filesystem::

    $ fusermount -u /mnt/backy-fuse


NOTES
=====

backy-fuse employs a two-tier cache scheme. Chunks are kept in a fixed-size read
only cache (512 MiB large by default). In case backup images are written to,
dirty pages are kept in an equally sized read-write cache.  If the dirty cache
grows largen than its allowed size, pages are written back to the backy store. A
subsequent `backy purge` run will clean it up.

Although technically possible, mounting backy-fuse images in read-write mode is
strongly recommended against. Use read-only mounts whereever possible.
Read-write access may be necessecary to replay journals in case of filesystem
corruption, though.
